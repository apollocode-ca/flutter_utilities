/// Class to bind [Event]s to widgets and functions efficiently.
///
/// INITIALIZE
/// Must be initialized in a service like that:
///   EventBinding<{the type you want}> event1 = EventBinding<{the type you want}>(event: "events/event1").
/// The name of the event must be relevant and the string of the event must be in the
/// format "category/eventName".
///
/// The [EventBinding] entity will treat data as a nullable of the type of data
/// you choose on initialization
///
/// SENDERS
/// You must register all the senders of the event like this in the initialize
/// function of the component like this:
///   services.events.event1.registerSender(sender: this).
///
/// You must unregister all the senders of the event in the disposal function
/// of the component like this:
///   services.events.event1.unregisterSender(sender: this).
///
///
/// Registering senders won't affect events running, but will widely help debugging and
/// monitoring.
///
/// To send a signal to an event, you must male a call where you need in a sender
/// like this:
///   services.events.event1.sendEvent(sender: this),
/// or like this if you need to send data:
///   services.events.event1.sendEvent(sender: this, data: data).
///
/// RECEIVERS
/// You must register all receivers with their binded functions in the inistate
/// function like this:
///   services.events.event1.bindEvent(receiver: this, context: context, bindFunction: bindFunction),
/// or like that if you need the data provided by the event:
///   services.events.event1.bindEventWithData(receiver: this, context: context, bindFunction: bindFunction).
///
/// You must unregister all receivers in the dispose function like this:
///   services.events.event1.unbindEvents(receiver: this).
///
/// The data provided by an event will be a nullable of the type you choose on
/// initialization. You must treat if the data is null or not in the widget.
